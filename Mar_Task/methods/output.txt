IF THE OPERAND IS NOT BOOL, IT IS CONVERTED TO BOOL USING CONTEXTUAL CONVERSION TO BOOL: IT IS ONLY WELL-FORMED IF THE DECLARATION BOOL T(ARG) IS WELL-FORMED, FOR SOME INVENTED TEMPORARY T.

THE RESULT IS A BOOL PRVALUE.

FOR THE BUILT-IN LOGICAL NOT OPERATOR, THE RESULT IS TRUE IF THE OPERAND IS FALSE. OTHERWISE, THE RESULT IS FALSE.

FOR THE BUILT-IN LOGICAL AND OPERATOR, THE RESULT IS TRUE IF BOTH OPERANDS ARE TRUE. OTHERWISE, THE RESULT IS FALSE. THIS OPERATOR IS SHORT-CIRCUITING: IF THE FIRST OPERAND IS FALSE, THE SECOND OPERAND IS NOT EVALUATED.

FOR THE BUILT-IN LOGICAL OR OPERATOR, THE RESULT IS TRUE IF EITHER THE FIRST OR THE SECOND OPERAND (OR BOTH) IS TRUE. THIS OPERATOR IS SHORT-CIRCUITING: IF THE FIRST OPERAND IS TRUE, THE SECOND OPERAND IS NOT EVALUATED.

NOTE THAT BITWISE LOGIC OPERATORS DO NOT PERFORM SHORT-CIRCUITING.

BECAUSE THE SHORT-CIRCUITING PROPERTIES OF OPERATOR&& AND OPERATOR|| DO NOT APPLY TO OVERLOADS, AND BECAUSE TYPES WITH BOOLEAN SEMANTICS ARE UNCOMMON, ONLY TWO STANDARD LIBRARY CLASSES OVERLOAD THESE OPERATORS:

STATIC_CAST CONVERTS ONE TYPE TO ANOTHER RELATED TYPE
DYNAMIC_CAST CONVERTS WITHIN INHERITANCE HIERARCHIES
CONST_CAST ADDS OR REMOVES CV-QUALIFIERS
REINTERPRET_CAST CONVERTS TYPE TO UNRELATED TYPE
C-STYLE CAST CONVERTS ONE TYPE TO ANOTHER BY A MIX OF STATIC_CAST, CONST_CAST, AND REINTERPRET_CAST
NEW CREATES OBJECTS WITH DYNAMIC STORAGE DURATION
DELETE DESTRUCTS OBJECTS PREVIOUSLY CREATED BY THE NEW EXPRESSION AND RELEASES OBTAINED MEMORY AREA
SIZEOF QUERIES THE SIZE OF A TYPE
SIZEOF... QUERIES THE SIZE OF A PACK (SINCE C++11)
TYPEID QUERIES THE TYPE INFORMATION OF A TYPE
NOEXCEPT CHECKS IF AN EXPRESSION CAN THROW AN EXCEPTION (SINCE C++11)
ALIGNOF QUERIES ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS OF A TYPE (SINCE C++11)
